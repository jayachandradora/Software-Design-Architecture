# Movie Review & Rating 

To design a system for movie reviews and ratings based on information gathered from three different sources, and then provide functionalities such as real-time calculations, top movies list, and individual movie ratings, we will break the design into key components. The solution will focus on:

- **Data Collection**: Collecting movie data from three websites
- **Backend API Design**: Exposing an API to serve user queries
- **Real-time Calculations**: Handling real-time review and rating calculations
- **Top 10 Movies**: Displaying the top 10 movies based on ratings
- **Scalability Considerations**: Making the system capable of handling 10 million daily users and 10,000 movies

### System Design Overview

---

### 1. **Data Collection from 3 Websites**

We need to gather movie data from three sources. This could be done using web scraping or APIs if the sites provide them.

- **Web Scraping**: We can use libraries like **JSoup** (for Java) to scrape movie data (titles, reviews, ratings) periodically.
- **API Integration**: If the websites provide APIs, we can integrate with them directly.

The data we collect will include:
- Movie Title
- Movie ID
- User Reviews
- Ratings (possibly on a scale of 1-10 or 1-5)
- Number of Reviews
- Release Date
- Other Metadata (actors, genres, etc.)

For real-time updates, data synchronization will be important. We can periodically update our database with new reviews or ratings (e.g., every minute or hour).

---

### 2. **Backend API Design**

We will design a RESTful API to interact with the system, supporting both read and write operations:

#### API Endpoints:
1. **GET /movies/top**  
   *Fetches the top 10 movies based on their ratings and reviews.*
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     [
       {
         "movie_id": 1,
         "title": "Movie A",
         "average_rating": 8.7,
         "review_count": 1500
       },
       ...
     ]
     ```

2. **GET /movies/{movie_id}**  
   *Fetches a specific movie's details including individual ratings and reviews.*
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     {
       "movie_id": 1,
       "title": "Movie A",
       "average_rating": 8.7,
       "reviews": [
         {
           "user_id": 101,
           "rating": 9,
           "review": "Great movie!"
         },
         ...
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **GET /movies/reviews**  
   *Fetch movies based on user-provided filters (e.g., movies in a certain genre with average ratings above a certain threshold).*
   - **Request:**
     ```json
     {
       "genre": "Action",
       "min_rating": 8
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     [
       {
         "movie_id": 2,
         "title": "Movie B",
         "average_rating": 8.5,
         "review_count": 500
       },
       ...
     ]
     ```

4. **POST /movies/{movie_id}/reviews**  
   *Allows users to post their review and rating for a specific movie.*
   - **Request:**
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": 102,
       "rating": 7,
       "review": "Not bad, but could have been better."
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success",
       "message": "Review submitted successfully"
     }
     ```

#### Database Design

We need a database to store movie data, user reviews, and ratings. Hereâ€™s an example schema:

- **Movies Table**: Stores metadata for each movie.
  - `movie_id` (Primary Key)
  - `title`
  - `release_date`
  - `genre`
  - `average_rating`
  - `review_count`

- **Reviews Table**: Stores individual user reviews for each movie.
  - `review_id` (Primary Key)
  - `movie_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `user_id`
  - `rating`
  - `review`
  - `timestamp`

- **Users Table**: Stores user information (if needed for registration and to prevent spamming reviews).
  - `user_id` (Primary Key)
  - `username`
  - `email`

#### Real-Time Rating Calculation

To calculate real-time ratings efficiently:
- **Caching**: Use a distributed caching system like **Redis** to cache the average rating of movies. This avoids recalculating the rating every time a query is made.
- **Incremental Updates**: When a new review is posted, we can update the cache incrementally without needing to recompute the entire dataset.
  - Example: If a new review for a movie comes in with a rating of 8, we update the average rating like this:

    ```
    new_average_rating = ((current_average_rating * review_count) + new_rating) / (review_count + 1)
    ```

- **Batch Updates**: Reviews could be processed in batches during periods of low activity (e.g., overnight), so the system doesn't become overloaded during peak times.

---

### 3. **Handling Scalability**

Since we expect 10 million users per day and 10,000 movies, we need to design the system with scalability in mind.

#### Key Considerations:
- **Load Balancing**: Use **load balancers** (e.g., AWS ELB, Nginx) to distribute incoming traffic to multiple application servers.
- **Database Sharding**: Shard the database by movie ID or user ID to distribute load and prevent any one server from becoming a bottleneck.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use queues (e.g., **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**) to process time-consuming tasks like recalculating ratings, sending notifications, etc.
- **Distributed Caching**: Use a distributed cache (e.g., **Redis** or **Memcached**) to store movie ratings and reduce database load.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Use a CDN for static content (e.g., images, movie posters, etc.) to speed up access for users.
- **Microservices Architecture**: If needed, split the application into microservices for movies, reviews, and user management to scale independently.

---

### 4. **Java API Implementation Example**

Here is an outline of how you can implement the API using **Spring Boot** (Java framework).

#### Setting Up Spring Boot
```bash
spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa,redis spring-boot-movie-rating-api
```

#### Controller Class
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/movies")
public class MovieController {

    @Autowired
    private MovieService movieService;

    @GetMapping("/top")
    public ResponseEntity<List<MovieDTO>> getTopMovies() {
        List<MovieDTO> topMovies = movieService.getTopMovies();
        return ResponseEntity.ok(topMovies);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{movieId}")
    public ResponseEntity<MovieDTO> getMovie(@PathVariable Long movieId) {
        MovieDTO movie = movieService.getMovieDetails(movieId);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(movie);
    }

    @PostMapping("/{movieId}/reviews")
    public ResponseEntity<String> postReview(@PathVariable Long movieId, @RequestBody ReviewRequest reviewRequest) {
        movieService.submitReview(movieId, reviewRequest);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body("Review submitted successfully");
    }
}
```

#### Service Class (Business Logic)
```java
@Service
public class MovieService {

    @Autowired
    private MovieRepository movieRepository;

    @Autowired
    private ReviewRepository reviewRepository;

    @Autowired
    private RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate;

    public List<MovieDTO> getTopMovies() {
        // Check if data is available in cache
        List<MovieDTO> topMovies = (List<MovieDTO>) redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("topMovies");
        if (topMovies == null) {
            // If not, fetch from DB, calculate and store in cache
            topMovies = movieRepository.findTopMovies();
            redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("topMovies", topMovies);
        }
        return topMovies;
    }

    public MovieDTO getMovieDetails(Long movieId) {
        Movie movie = movieRepository.findById(movieId).orElseThrow(() -> new MovieNotFoundException(movieId));
        List<Review> reviews = reviewRepository.findByMovieId(movieId);
        return new MovieDTO(movie, reviews);
    }

    public void submitReview(Long movieId, ReviewRequest reviewRequest) {
        // Save the review in the DB
        Review review = new Review(movieId, reviewRequest.getUserId(), reviewRequest.getRating(), reviewRequest.getReview());
        reviewRepository.save(review);

        // Update movie's average rating
        movieRepository.updateMovieRating(movieId, reviewRequest.getRating());
        // Clear cache for this movie
        redisTemplate.delete("movie_" + movieId);
    }
}
```

#### Database Repositories
```java
public interface MovieRepository extends JpaRepository<Movie, Long> {
    @Query("SELECT m FROM Movie m ORDER BY m.averageRating DESC")
    List<MovieDTO> findTopMovies();

    @Modifying
    @Query("UPDATE Movie m SET m.averageRating = :rating WHERE m.id = :movieId")
    void updateMovieRating(Long movieId, Double rating);
}

public interface ReviewRepository extends JpaRepository<Review, Long> {
    List<Review> findByMovieId(Long movieId);
}
```

#### Redis

 Cache Setup
```java
@Configuration
public class RedisConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate(RedisConnectionFactory factory) {
        RedisTemplate<String, Object> template = new RedisTemplate<>();
        template.setConnectionFactory(factory);
        return template;
    }
}
```

### 5. **Performance and Load Testing**

Before going live, ensure to:
- Perform load testing using tools like **JMeter** or **Gatling** to simulate user traffic.
- Optimize database queries and caching mechanisms for fast read and write operations.

---

This design handles high traffic (10 million users), large datasets (10,000 movies), and real-time movie reviews and ratings. The system ensures scalability, reliability, and efficiency by utilizing caching, distributed processing, and a robust API architecture.

# Next Level Scaling To Above solution

Scaling a real-time movie review and rating system to handle large volumes of data, frequent updates, and high traffic requires careful architectural planning. While SQL databases (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) are reliable for structured data, there are alternatives and techniques you can use to ensure high scalability, real-time performance, and low latency.

### Key Challenges for Scaling:
1. **Handling high traffic and large volumes of data.**
2. **Providing real-time updates to movie ratings and reviews.**
3. **Ensuring low latency for fetching movie ratings.**
4. **Avoiding bottlenecks in data fetching and aggregation.**

### 1. **Leveraging NoSQL Databases**
SQL databases are good for structured relationships, but when you need **horizontal scaling** and **real-time performance**, **NoSQL databases** like **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, or **Elasticsearch** could be more effective in this case.

- **MongoDB** is a document-based database that supports fast reads and writes with schema flexibility. It scales well horizontally, which is essential when dealing with large datasets.
- **Elasticsearch** is optimized for full-text search and aggregation. It's excellent for real-time analytics and can help you handle user queries, such as fetching the top 10 movies quickly.
- **Cassandra** is a distributed database that excels in write-heavy workloads, which is beneficial for real-time systems like this one.

#### How to use NoSQL for movie ratings:
1. **Movie Data Structure (MongoDB Example)**:
   You could store movie data in a format like this in **MongoDB**:
   ```json
   {
     "movie_id": "12345",
     "movie_title": "Inception",
     "ratings": [
       {
         "source": "Site1",
         "rating": 8.5,
         "review_count": 1200
       },
       {
         "source": "Site2",
         "rating": 7.8,
         "review_count": 950
       },
       {
         "source": "Site3",
         "rating": 8.0,
         "review_count": 1100
       }
     ],
     "aggregated_rating": 8.1,
     "last_updated": "2025-01-03T00:00:00Z"
   }
   ```

   In this case, each movie document contains:
   - A list of ratings from the different sources.
   - An aggregated rating, which can be calculated by your system.
   - The `last_updated` field to track when the movie data was last refreshed.

2. **Real-Time Aggregation in NoSQL:**
   - Instead of calculating the aggregated rating every time a query is made, you can **pre-compute** and store the aggregated rating in the database.
   - When new ratings or reviews come in, update the database in **real-time**. With NoSQL, updates can be faster as they allow for distributed writes, reducing the load on any single node.

3. **Real-Time Data Ingestion:**
   - You could use **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** to handle real-time streams of rating and review data.
   - As new ratings and reviews come in from your external sources, you can push these events to a Kafka topic. A backend service can then consume these events, update the database in real-time, and aggregate the ratings.

#### Benefits of NoSQL for this use case:
- **Scalability:** NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle high volumes of reads and writes without significant degradation in performance.
- **Real-time Processing:** You can use streaming and aggregation techniques to calculate real-time ratings.
- **Flexibility:** NoSQL allows you to store unstructured or semi-structured data, which is useful when dealing with different sources of ratings and reviews.

### 2. **Caching for Fast Real-Time Queries**
Real-time performance can be significantly improved with **caching**. Caching frequently accessed data reduces the load on your database and speeds up response times. This is especially important when users frequently query the same movies.

- **Redis** is an excellent choice for caching. You can store the most popular movie ratings and reviews in Redis and set an expiration time for the cache (e.g., 1 hour). 
- **CDN Caching:** For content-heavy sites, you can also cache static assets and even some API responses at the **edge** using **Content Delivery Networks** (CDNs) like **Cloudflare** or **AWS CloudFront**.

#### How to Implement Caching:
- Cache the **aggregated movie ratings** and **top 10 movies** for frequent queries. 
- Cache the movie details (e.g., title, genre, release date, etc.) alongside the rating data.
- Invalidate the cache after a certain period or when new data is ingested.

#### Cache Invalidation:
Use **TTL (Time to Live)** in your cache to ensure the data isn't stale. When a movieâ€™s rating is updated (or new data is added), the cached data should be invalidated or updated accordingly.

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture for Real-Time Updates**
For large-scale systems, an **event-driven architecture** is key to handling real-time data.

- Use a message queue like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** to process incoming ratings and reviews asynchronously.
- As new reviews come in from your external sources (via scraping or APIs), the system triggers events that aggregate the new data, update the movie's ratings, and refresh the cache.
  
#### Kafka Integration for Real-Time Updates:
1. **Producer (Data Source)**: External systems (your 3 movie sources) send new review data into a Kafka topic.
2. **Consumer (Backend Service)**: A backend service listens to this Kafka topic, processes the review data (aggregates ratings, updates the database, refreshes caches).
3. **Real-Time UI**: Your frontend can listen for updates (via WebSockets, for instance) and dynamically refresh the UI with new ratings or the top 10 movies.

### 4. **Using Elasticsearch for Aggregation and Search**
**Elasticsearch** is a powerful search engine that can also be used for real-time aggregation and analytics. It excels in handling large datasets and allows you to perform complex queries, like finding the top 10 movies based on ratings, in **real-time**.

- **Movie Index**: Store movies and ratings in Elasticsearch, and use it for both search (finding movies by title) and real-time aggregation.
- **Real-Time Aggregation**: Elasticsearch supports **aggregations** that allow you to calculate averages, percentiles, and other statistics on the fly. You can use it to calculate aggregated ratings for each movie and fetch the top 10 rated movies in real-time.

#### Elasticsearch Use Case:
- For fetching the **top 10 movies**, you can use an aggregation query like this:
  ```json
  {
    "size": 10,
    "query": {
      "match_all": {}
    },
    "sort": [
      {
        "aggregated_rating": {
          "order": "desc"
        }
      }
    ],
    "aggs": {
      "rating_avg": {
        "avg": {
          "field": "aggregated_rating"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 5. **Microservices Architecture for Scalability**
As your system grows, adopting a **microservices architecture** can help you scale independently and manage complexity better.

- **Movie Service**: A dedicated service that handles fetching, storing, and updating movie ratings.
- **Cache Service**: A service responsible for managing the caching layer (e.g., Redis).
- **Search Service**: A microservice that interfaces with Elasticsearch for real-time aggregation and movie search.

This modular approach ensures that you can scale each component independently based on traffic needs, such as spinning up more instances of the cache service during high traffic periods.

```

### **Conclusion**

By using a combination of **NoSQL databases**, **event-driven architecture**, **real-time streaming (Kafka)**, **caching (Redis)**, and **Elasticsearch**, you can build a highly scalable and performant movie rating and review system that can handle millions of users, real-time data, and high-volume updates without relying solely on traditional SQL databases.

This architecture ensures that your system can scale horizontally, provide low-latency queries, and handle the real-time nature of the movie data.

# Leveraging Count-Min Sketch (CMS) algorithm 

The **Count-Min Sketch (CMS)** algorithm is a **probabilistic data structure** used for approximating the frequency of events in a large dataset. It's particularly well-suited for high-frequency, low-memory, and low-latency systems, where you need to track frequencies or counts of events but can tolerate small errors in the estimates. Given its ability to handle large-scale data efficiently, the **Count-Min Sketch** can be highly effective for your movie rating system, particularly when scaling to a large number of users and data sources.

In the context of your **movie review and rating system**, you can use **Count-Min Sketch** to:

1. **Track the frequency of movie ratings** (e.g., number of reviews or occurrences of a particular rating) in real time.
2. **Efficiently compute approximate aggregated ratings** across multiple sources.
3. **Track top movies** or those with the most reviews efficiently, even in a distributed system.

### **How Count-Min Sketch Fits Into the System**

The main idea is that Count-Min Sketch can help with two critical aspects of your system:
1. **Real-Time Rating Aggregation** â€” By maintaining an approximate frequency table of ratings.
2. **Top Movies Calculation** â€” By efficiently calculating the "most popular" movies (i.e., those with the most reviews or highest ratings) in real-time.

### **Steps to Apply Count-Min Sketch in Your System**

#### **1. Count-Min Sketch Overview**
The Count-Min Sketch uses a **hashing technique** to approximate the count (or frequency) of items. It operates by maintaining a 2D array of counters (called "sketches"). The rows in the array are each hashed using different hash functions, and each movie's rating or review count is updated at the intersections of the corresponding hash values.

- **Error Bounds:** You can configure the Count-Min Sketch to trade off between **memory usage** and **accuracy**. By adjusting the width (number of columns) and depth (number of rows) of the CMS, you can control the error rates.
- **Space Efficiency:** Itâ€™s memory-efficient because it doesnâ€™t need to store the full list of ratings and reviews but only the counts for each hash.

#### **2. Scaling Aggregated Ratings with Count-Min Sketch**

Hereâ€™s how you can integrate the **Count-Min Sketch** to scale real-time aggregation of movie ratings:

- **Track Movie Ratings:** When a new review or rating comes in for a movie, the CMS is updated by incrementing counters in a sketch structure corresponding to that movie's ID and rating.
- **Approximate Aggregation:** Instead of storing exact counts and ratings for each movie from each source, CMS gives you an **approximate frequency count** for each movieâ€™s rating, allowing you to quickly calculate an approximate aggregated rating.

##### **Example Data Flow:**

1. **New Rating Arrives:**
   - A new review is fetched from an external source (e.g., Site1).
   - The movie's ID and the rating are mapped to a Count-Min Sketch using a hash function.
   - The frequency of that movie and rating is updated in the CMS.

2. **Update Aggregated Rating (Approximation):**
   - When displaying the aggregated rating for a movie, you can take the **average** of the ratings in the Count-Min Sketch, which can be approximated by using the count of reviews and the sum of ratings (this can be derived through hash collisions).

3. **Update Real-Time Rankings:**
   - The CMS maintains approximate counts of movie reviews (or aggregated ratings). Using this data, you can efficiently calculate which movies are "top-rated" or "most popular" based on the frequency of reviews or ratings.

#### **3. Using Count-Min Sketch for Top 10 Movies**

The Count-Min Sketch can also be used to **track and rank movies based on review counts or aggregated ratings** efficiently in real-time:

1. **Top Movies by Count of Reviews:**
   - Maintain a CMS where each movieâ€™s ID is hashed and stored with its review count. When a movieâ€™s review count increases, update the CMS.
   - To find the top movies (most reviewed), simply query the CMS for the movies with the highest counts.

2. **Top Movies by Aggregated Rating:**
   - Maintain a separate CMS for each source of reviews to approximate ratings.
   - Use multiple CMS tables to track the average or cumulative ratings for each movie (across all sources).
   - Rank movies by their **aggregated rating estimates**.

   To compute the **approximate aggregated rating**:
   - Count-Min Sketch doesn't directly store ratings but only counts, so you would need to **calculate weighted ratings** by keeping track of total ratings for each movie.
   - Use the `total sum` of ratings and divide by the **count of reviews** to estimate the average rating.

#### **4. Efficient Real-Time Movie Query with Count-Min Sketch**

For querying individual movies (e.g., a user searches for a movie to get its rating):

1. The CMS will give an **approximate review count** and **aggregated rating**.
2. Since the data in CMS is an approximation, the **error rate** can be adjusted using more rows or columns for better precision at the cost of more memory.

#### **5. Using Multiple CMS for Different Dimensions (Scaling Across Sources)**

If you have data from multiple sources, you can use **multiple Count-Min Sketches** for each source to maintain independence and avoid interference:

- **CMS for Source 1**: Tracks the count and aggregated rating for reviews from Source 1.
- **CMS for Source 2**: Tracks the count and aggregated rating for reviews from Source 2.
- **CMS for Source 3**: Tracks the count and aggregated rating for reviews from Source 3.

Then, for the final aggregated rating:
1. You can combine the results of these individual CMS structures by computing a **weighted average** or **total sum** based on the count or rating from each source.

This can be done by:
1. Taking the counts and ratings from each CMS.
2. Combining them using a **weighted aggregation formula** based on the importance of each source or the number of reviews from each source.

#### **6. Performance and Scalability Considerations**

- **Memory Usage:** By tuning the **depth** (number of rows) and **width** (number of columns) of the CMS, you can balance memory usage and accuracy. A larger CMS will reduce error rates but require more memory.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism:** Since CMS is a simple and fast algorithm, it can be updated concurrently without significant performance hits. If your system is distributed, you can update CMS in parallel across multiple nodes (for example, when processing different batches of incoming reviews).
- **Distributed CMS:** For large-scale systems, you can distribute the CMS across multiple servers or databases. This is especially useful when you need to handle **distributed writes** and **high traffic**.

#### **7. Real-Time Updates Using CMS and Streaming**

For real-time updates, combine **Count-Min Sketch** with **stream processing** frameworks like **Apache Kafka** or **Apache Flink**. This allows you to process incoming rating data streams and update the CMS in real-time.

- **Stream Rating Data**: As each new rating comes in (via a Kafka topic or a similar system), it triggers an update to the CMS.
- **Real-Time Aggregation**: The system can compute and rank movies continuously based on the current state of the CMS.

### **Scaling Example with Count-Min Sketch**

Let's consider a system with millions of movies and reviews. Here's how CMS can help:

1. **For Real-Time Rating Calculation:**
   - As users submit reviews across millions of movies, CMS helps track the approximate counts and ratings in **constant time**.
   - The system doesn't need to maintain large, expensive in-memory or SQL tables with precise counts.

2. **For Top 10 Movies:**
   - Track the most popular or top-rated movies using CMS by maintaining frequency counts of reviews.
   - With CMS, finding the top 10 movies becomes an **O(1)** operation â€” simply read the sketch for the counts and sort them.

3. **For Querying Individual Movies:**
   - Query the CMS for an approximate rating or review count in near real-time without incurring a heavy processing load.

### **Implementation Strategy**

1. **CMS Library Integration:**
   Use an existing CMS library or implement your own:
   - For **Python**, you can use libraries like `countminsketch` or `datasketch`.
   - For **JavaScript/Node.js**, there are libraries such as `count-min-sketch`.
   
2. **Distributed CMS**: Implement the CMS across distributed systems (e.g., using **Apache Kafka** for real-time streaming and **Redis** for caching) to handle large-scale, distributed updates in real-time.

### **Conclusion**

Using **Count-Min Sketch** in your movie rating system enables **efficient real-time updates, memory savings**, and **low-latency aggregation**. It is especially effective for large-scale systems where you need to process and rank data in real-time, without the overhead of storing every review and maintaining exact counts.

By leveraging CMS, you can scale your system to handle millions of reviews and users, provide fast real-time rating calculations, and efficiently manage memory usage. With this approach, you can **achieve a highly scalable, low-latency movie review and rating system** that provides approximate but very accurate insights for your users.
