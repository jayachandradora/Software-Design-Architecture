# Movie Review and Rating 

To design a system for movie reviews and ratings based on information gathered from three different sources, and then provide functionalities such as real-time calculations, top movies list, and individual movie ratings, we will break the design into key components. The solution will focus on:

- **Data Collection**: Collecting movie data from three websites
- **Backend API Design**: Exposing an API to serve user queries
- **Real-time Calculations**: Handling real-time review and rating calculations
- **Top 10 Movies**: Displaying the top 10 movies based on ratings
- **Scalability Considerations**: Making the system capable of handling 10 million daily users and 10,000 movies

### System Design Overview

---

### 1. **Data Collection from 3 Websites**

We need to gather movie data from three sources. This could be done using web scraping or APIs if the sites provide them.

- **Web Scraping**: We can use libraries like **JSoup** (for Java) to scrape movie data (titles, reviews, ratings) periodically.
- **API Integration**: If the websites provide APIs, we can integrate with them directly.

The data we collect will include:
- Movie Title
- Movie ID
- User Reviews
- Ratings (possibly on a scale of 1-10 or 1-5)
- Number of Reviews
- Release Date
- Other Metadata (actors, genres, etc.)

For real-time updates, data synchronization will be important. We can periodically update our database with new reviews or ratings (e.g., every minute or hour).

---

### 2. **Backend API Design**

We will design a RESTful API to interact with the system, supporting both read and write operations:

#### API Endpoints:
1. **GET /movies/top**  
   *Fetches the top 10 movies based on their ratings and reviews.*
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     [
       {
         "movie_id": 1,
         "title": "Movie A",
         "average_rating": 8.7,
         "review_count": 1500
       },
       ...
     ]
     ```

2. **GET /movies/{movie_id}**  
   *Fetches a specific movie's details including individual ratings and reviews.*
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     {
       "movie_id": 1,
       "title": "Movie A",
       "average_rating": 8.7,
       "reviews": [
         {
           "user_id": 101,
           "rating": 9,
           "review": "Great movie!"
         },
         ...
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **GET /movies/reviews**  
   *Fetch movies based on user-provided filters (e.g., movies in a certain genre with average ratings above a certain threshold).*
   - **Request:**
     ```json
     {
       "genre": "Action",
       "min_rating": 8
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     [
       {
         "movie_id": 2,
         "title": "Movie B",
         "average_rating": 8.5,
         "review_count": 500
       },
       ...
     ]
     ```

4. **POST /movies/{movie_id}/reviews**  
   *Allows users to post their review and rating for a specific movie.*
   - **Request:**
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": 102,
       "rating": 7,
       "review": "Not bad, but could have been better."
     }
     ```
   - **Response:**
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success",
       "message": "Review submitted successfully"
     }
     ```

#### Database Design

We need a database to store movie data, user reviews, and ratings. Hereâ€™s an example schema:

- **Movies Table**: Stores metadata for each movie.
  - `movie_id` (Primary Key)
  - `title`
  - `release_date`
  - `genre`
  - `average_rating`
  - `review_count`

- **Reviews Table**: Stores individual user reviews for each movie.
  - `review_id` (Primary Key)
  - `movie_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `user_id`
  - `rating`
  - `review`
  - `timestamp`

- **Users Table**: Stores user information (if needed for registration and to prevent spamming reviews).
  - `user_id` (Primary Key)
  - `username`
  - `email`

#### Real-Time Rating Calculation

To calculate real-time ratings efficiently:
- **Caching**: Use a distributed caching system like **Redis** to cache the average rating of movies. This avoids recalculating the rating every time a query is made.
- **Incremental Updates**: When a new review is posted, we can update the cache incrementally without needing to recompute the entire dataset.
  - Example: If a new review for a movie comes in with a rating of 8, we update the average rating like this:

    ```
    new_average_rating = ((current_average_rating * review_count) + new_rating) / (review_count + 1)
    ```

- **Batch Updates**: Reviews could be processed in batches during periods of low activity (e.g., overnight), so the system doesn't become overloaded during peak times.

---

### 3. **Handling Scalability**

Since we expect 10 million users per day and 10,000 movies, we need to design the system with scalability in mind.

#### Key Considerations:
- **Load Balancing**: Use **load balancers** (e.g., AWS ELB, Nginx) to distribute incoming traffic to multiple application servers.
- **Database Sharding**: Shard the database by movie ID or user ID to distribute load and prevent any one server from becoming a bottleneck.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use queues (e.g., **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ**) to process time-consuming tasks like recalculating ratings, sending notifications, etc.
- **Distributed Caching**: Use a distributed cache (e.g., **Redis** or **Memcached**) to store movie ratings and reduce database load.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Use a CDN for static content (e.g., images, movie posters, etc.) to speed up access for users.
- **Microservices Architecture**: If needed, split the application into microservices for movies, reviews, and user management to scale independently.

### 4. **Java API Implementation Example**

Here is an outline of how you can implement the API using **Spring Boot** (Java framework).

#### Setting Up Spring Boot
```bash
spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa,redis spring-boot-movie-rating-api
```

#### Controller Class
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/movies")
public class MovieController {

    @Autowired
    private MovieService movieService;

    @GetMapping("/top")
    public ResponseEntity<List<MovieDTO>> getTopMovies() {
        List<MovieDTO> topMovies = movieService.getTopMovies();
        return ResponseEntity.ok(topMovies);
    }

    @GetMapping("/{movieId}")
    public ResponseEntity<MovieDTO> getMovie(@PathVariable Long movieId) {
        MovieDTO movie = movieService.getMovieDetails(movieId);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(movie);
    }

    @PostMapping("/{movieId}/reviews")
    public ResponseEntity<String> postReview(@PathVariable Long movieId, @RequestBody ReviewRequest reviewRequest) {
        movieService.submitReview(movieId, reviewRequest);
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body("Review submitted successfully");
    }
}
```

#### Service Class (Business Logic)
```java
@Service
public class MovieService {

    @Autowired
    private MovieRepository movieRepository;

    @Autowired
    private ReviewRepository reviewRepository;

    @Autowired
    private RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate;

    public List<MovieDTO> getTopMovies() {
        // Check if data is available in cache
        List<MovieDTO> topMovies = (List<MovieDTO>) redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("topMovies");
        if (topMovies == null) {
            // If not, fetch from DB, calculate and store in cache
            topMovies = movieRepository.findTopMovies();
            redisTemplate.opsForValue().set("topMovies", topMovies);
        }
        return topMovies;
    }

    public MovieDTO getMovieDetails(Long movieId) {
        Movie movie = movieRepository.findById(movieId).orElseThrow(() -> new MovieNotFoundException(movieId));
        List<Review> reviews = reviewRepository.findByMovieId(movieId);
        return new MovieDTO(movie, reviews);
    }

    public void submitReview(Long movieId, ReviewRequest reviewRequest) {
        // Save the review in the DB
        Review review = new Review(movieId, reviewRequest.getUserId(), reviewRequest.getRating(), reviewRequest.getReview());
        reviewRepository.save(review);

        // Update movie's average rating
        movieRepository.updateMovieRating(movieId, reviewRequest.getRating());
        // Clear cache for this movie
        redisTemplate.delete("movie_" + movieId);
    }
}
```

#### Database Repositories
```java
public interface MovieRepository extends JpaRepository<Movie, Long> {
    @Query("SELECT m FROM Movie m ORDER BY m.averageRating DESC")
    List<MovieDTO> findTopMovies();

    @Modifying
    @Query("UPDATE Movie m SET m.averageRating = :rating WHERE m.id = :movieId")
    void updateMovieRating(Long movieId, Double rating);
}

public interface ReviewRepository extends JpaRepository<Review, Long> {
    List<Review> findByMovieId(Long movieId);
}
```

#### Redis

 Cache Setup
```java
@Configuration
public class RedisConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate(RedisConnectionFactory factory) {
        RedisTemplate<String, Object> template = new RedisTemplate<>();
        template.setConnectionFactory(factory);
        return template;
    }
}
```

### 5. **Performance and Load Testing**

Before going live, ensure to:
- Perform load testing using tools like **JMeter** or **Gatling** to simulate user traffic.
- Optimize database queries and caching mechanisms for fast read and write operations.

---

This design handles high traffic (10 million users), large datasets (10,000 movies), and real-time movie reviews and ratings. The system ensures scalability, reliability, and efficiency by utilizing caching, distributed processing, and a robust API architecture.

# Next Level Scaling To Above solution

Scaling a real-time movie review and rating system to handle large volumes of data, frequent updates, and high traffic requires careful architectural planning. While SQL databases (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) are reliable for structured data, there are alternatives and techniques you can use to ensure high scalability, real-time performance, and low latency.

### Key Challenges for Scaling:
1. **Handling high traffic and large volumes of data.**
2. **Providing real-time updates to movie ratings and reviews.**
3. **Ensuring low latency for fetching movie ratings.**
4. **Avoiding bottlenecks in data fetching and aggregation.**

### 1. **Leveraging NoSQL Databases**
SQL databases are good for structured relationships, but when you need **horizontal scaling** and **real-time performance**, **NoSQL databases** like **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, or **Elasticsearch** could be more effective in this case.

- **MongoDB** is a document-based database that supports fast reads and writes with schema flexibility. It scales well horizontally, which is essential when dealing with large datasets.
- **Elasticsearch** is optimized for full-text search and aggregation. It's excellent for real-time analytics and can help you handle user queries, such as fetching the top 10 movies quickly.
- **Cassandra** is a distributed database that excels in write-heavy workloads, which is beneficial for real-time systems like this one.

#### How to use NoSQL for movie ratings:
1. **Movie Data Structure (MongoDB Example)**:
   You could store movie data in a format like this in **MongoDB**:
   ```json
   {
     "movie_id": "12345",
     "movie_title": "Inception",
     "ratings": [
       {
         "source": "Site1",
         "rating": 8.5,
         "review_count": 1200
       },
       {
         "source": "Site2",
         "rating": 7.8,
         "review_count": 950
       },
       {
         "source": "Site3",
         "rating": 8.0,
         "review_count": 1100
       }
     ],
     "aggregated_rating": 8.1,
     "last_updated": "2025-01-03T00:00:00Z"
   }
   ```

   In this case, each movie document contains:
   - A list of ratings from the different sources.
   - An aggregated rating, which can be calculated by your system.
   - The `last_updated` field to track when the movie data was last refreshed.

2. **Real-Time Aggregation in NoSQL:**
   - Instead of calculating the aggregated rating every time a query is made, you can **pre-compute** and store the aggregated rating in the database.
   - When new ratings or reviews come in, update the database in **real-time**. With NoSQL, updates can be faster as they allow for distributed writes, reducing the load on any single node.

3. **Real-Time Data Ingestion:**
   - You could use **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** to handle real-time streams of rating and review data.
   - As new ratings and reviews come in from your external sources, you can push these events to a Kafka topic. A backend service can then consume these events, update the database in real-time, and aggregate the ratings.

#### Benefits of NoSQL for this use case:
- **Scalability:** NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle high volumes of reads and writes without significant degradation in performance.
- **Real-time Processing:** You can use streaming and aggregation techniques to calculate real-time ratings.
- **Flexibility:** NoSQL allows you to store unstructured or semi-structured data, which is useful when dealing with different sources of ratings and reviews.

### 2. **Caching for Fast Real-Time Queries**
Real-time performance can be significantly improved with **caching**. Caching frequently accessed data reduces the load on your database and speeds up response times. This is especially important when users frequently query the same movies.

- **Redis** is an excellent choice for caching. You can store the most popular movie ratings and reviews in Redis and set an expiration time for the cache (e.g., 1 hour). 
- **CDN Caching:** For content-heavy sites, you can also cache static assets and even some API responses at the **edge** using **Content Delivery Networks** (CDNs) like **Cloudflare** or **AWS CloudFront**.

#### How to Implement Caching:
- Cache the **aggregated movie ratings** and **top 10 movies** for frequent queries. 
- Cache the movie details (e.g., title, genre, release date, etc.) alongside the rating data.
- Invalidate the cache after a certain period or when new data is ingested.

#### Cache Invalidation:
Use **TTL (Time to Live)** in your cache to ensure the data isn't stale. When a movieâ€™s rating is updated (or new data is added), the cached data should be invalidated or updated accordingly.

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture for Real-Time Updates**
For large-scale systems, an **event-driven architecture** is key to handling real-time data.

- Use a message queue like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** to process incoming ratings and reviews asynchronously.
- As new reviews come in from your external sources (via scraping or APIs), the system triggers events that aggregate the new data, update the movie's ratings, and refresh the cache.
  
#### Kafka Integration for Real-Time Updates:
1. **Producer (Data Source)**: External systems (your 3 movie sources) send new review data into a Kafka topic.
2. **Consumer (Backend Service)**: A backend service listens to this Kafka topic, processes the review data (aggregates ratings, updates the database, refreshes caches).
3. **Real-Time UI**: Your frontend can listen for updates (via WebSockets, for instance) and dynamically refresh the UI with new ratings or the top 10 movies.

### 4. **Using Elasticsearch for Aggregation and Search**
**Elasticsearch** is a powerful search engine that can also be used for real-time aggregation and analytics. It excels in handling large datasets and allows you to perform complex queries, like finding the top 10 movies based on ratings, in **real-time**.

- **Movie Index**: Store movies and ratings in Elasticsearch, and use it for both search (finding movies by title) and real-time aggregation.
- **Real-Time Aggregation**: Elasticsearch supports **aggregations** that allow you to calculate averages, percentiles, and other statistics on the fly. You can use it to calculate aggregated ratings for each movie and fetch the top 10 rated movies in real-time.

#### Elasticsearch Use Case:
- For fetching the **top 10 movies**, you can use an aggregation query like this:
  ```json
  {
    "size": 10,
    "query": {
      "match_all": {}
    },
    "sort": [
      {
        "aggregated_rating": {
          "order": "desc"
        }
      }
    ],
    "aggs": {
      "rating_avg": {
        "avg": {
          "field": "aggregated_rating"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 5. **Microservices Architecture for Scalability**
As your system grows, adopting a **microservices architecture** can help you scale independently and manage complexity better.

- **Movie Service**: A dedicated service that handles fetching, storing, and updating movie ratings.
- **Cache Service**: A service responsible for managing the caching layer (e.g., Redis).
- **Search Service**: A microservice that interfaces with Elasticsearch for real-time aggregation and movie search.

This modular approach ensures that you can scale each component independently based on traffic needs, such as spinning up more instances of the cache service during high traffic periods.

              +---------------------+---------------+
```

### **Conclusion**

By using a combination of **NoSQL databases**, **event-driven architecture**, **real-time streaming (Kafka)**, **caching (Redis)**, and **Elasticsearch**, you can build a highly scalable and performant movie rating and review system that can handle millions of users, real-time data, and high-volume updates without relying solely on traditional SQL databases.

This architecture ensures that your system can scale horizontally, provide low-latency queries, and handle the real-time nature of the movie data.
