## Estimating the capacity

Estimating the capacity for Agoda's system design involves assessing various factors to ensure the platform can handle expected traffic, data volumes, and user interactions efficiently. Here’s an outline of capacity estimation considerations:

### Traffic Volume:

1. **Expected User Base**:
   - Determine the number of active users visiting Agoda's platform daily, weekly, and during peak periods (e.g., holiday seasons).
   - Estimate concurrent users accessing the system simultaneously.

2. **Page Views and Requests**:
   - Calculate the number of page views per user session.
   - Estimate the number of API requests and database queries per second.

### Data Storage:

1. **Transactional Data**:
   - Estimate the size and growth rate of transactional data (e.g., user profiles, bookings, payments).
   - Determine daily, weekly, and monthly data ingestion rates.

2. **Content Storage**:
   - Assess storage requirements for multimedia content (e.g., hotel images, reviews).
   - Plan for scalability to accommodate increasing content volume.

### Processing and Compute Requirements:

1. **Compute Resources**:
   - Estimate CPU and memory requirements based on anticipated workload.
   - Consider distributed computing for handling concurrent requests and data processing.

2. **Database Throughput**:
   - Calculate read and write throughput for databases (e.g., MySQL, NoSQL) based on transaction rates and query complexity.
   - Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis, Memcached) for frequently accessed data.

### Networking and Infrastructure:

1. **Bandwidth Requirements**:
   - Determine bandwidth needs for data transfer between servers, clients, and external services (e.g., payment gateways, hotel APIs).

2. **Network Latency**:
   - Assess network latency requirements to ensure responsive user experience, especially for global users.

### Scalability and Elasticity:

1. **Scaling Strategy**:
   - Plan for horizontal scaling using cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure) to accommodate traffic spikes and future growth.
   - Implement auto-scaling policies based on predefined metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, request rate).

2. **High Availability**:
   - Design for fault tolerance and redundancy to minimize downtime and ensure continuous service availability.
   - Use load balancers and failover mechanisms to distribute traffic and mitigate single points of failure.

### Monitoring and Optimization:

1. **Monitoring Tools**:
   - Implement monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Nagios) for real-time performance metrics, resource utilization, and system health.

2. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - Continuously optimize code, database queries, and infrastructure configurations to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
   - Conduct load testing and performance tuning exercises to validate capacity estimates and identify bottlenecks.

### Conclusion:

Capacity estimation for Agoda's system design involves a detailed assessment of traffic patterns, data storage requirements, compute resources, networking needs, scalability strategies, and monitoring practices. By accurately estimating these factors, Agoda can build and maintain a robust, scalable platform that delivers a seamless and responsive user experience while handling varying levels of demand and growth.

### Handling distributed transactions

By addressing these functional and non-functional requirements and considering key design aspects, Agoda can develop a robust and efficient hotel booking system that meets user expectations while ensuring reliability, security, and scalability.

Handling distributed transactions in distributed systems is crucial for ensuring data consistency and reliability across multiple independent services or databases. Here are some common patterns and strategies for managing distributed transactions:

### 1. Two-Phase Commit (2PC):

- **Description**: Two-Phase Commit is a classic distributed transaction protocol that ensures all participating services agree on committing or rolling back a transaction.
  
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Prepare Phase**: Coordinator (typically the transaction manager) sends a prepare request to all participants, asking if they can commit the transaction.
  2. **Commit Phase**: If all participants confirm readiness (acknowledge prepare), the coordinator sends a commit request to all. If any participant fails or votes to abort during the prepare phase, the coordinator sends a rollback request to all participants.

- **Pros**: Provides strong consistency guarantees.
- **Cons**: Suffers from blocking issues, increased latency, and is prone to single-point-of-failure with the coordinator.

### 2. Saga Pattern:

- **Description**: Saga is a distributed transaction pattern where a large transaction is split into multiple smaller, local transactions that can be individually committed or rolled back.
  
- **Workflow**:
  - Each service involved in the saga maintains its own transaction state and compensating actions to rollback changes if needed.
  - Services communicate asynchronously and can continue with local transactions even if one or more previous steps fail.

- **Pros**: Provides better scalability, fault tolerance, and can handle long-running transactions.
- **Cons**: Requires careful design of compensating transactions (compensation logic) for rollback scenarios.

### 3. Compensating Transaction Pattern:

- **Description**: Also known as Compensation-Based Transaction, this pattern focuses on explicitly defining compensating actions to undo changes made by a transaction if it fails.
  
- **Workflow**:
  - Each transaction includes a compensation phase that is executed if the transaction fails or is rolled back.
  - Compensating actions are idempotent and designed to revert the effects of the original transaction.

- **Pros**: Simplifies rollback handling and is resilient to failures.
- **Cons**: Requires careful design of compensating actions and may not provide the same level of strong consistency as two-phase commit.

### 4. Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):

- **Description**: Event Sourcing involves capturing all changes to application state as a sequence of events, while CQRS separates read and write operations.
  
- **Workflow**:
  - Events are stored in an event log and serve as the source of truth.
  - Commands modify state based on events, and queries derive state from events.

- **Pros**: Supports scalable and resilient architectures, enabling eventual consistency and handling of complex transactional workflows.
- **Cons**: Introduces complexity, especially around event storage, event processing, and consistency models.

### 5. Idempotent Operations and Idempotent APIs:

- **Description**: Designing operations and APIs to be idempotent ensures that repeating the same operation multiple times has the same effect as performing it once.
  
- **Workflow**:
  - Clients generate and include unique identifiers (idempotency keys) with requests.
  - Servers check these keys to prevent processing duplicate requests.

- **Pros**: Simple to implement and improves fault tolerance.
- **Cons**: Limited to scenarios where idempotency can be guaranteed, and may not provide full ACID transactional guarantees.

### Considerations for Distributed Transactions:

- **Latency and Performance**: Distributed transactions often incur higher latency due to network communication and coordination.
- **Consistency Models**: Choose the appropriate consistency model (strong, eventual, etc.) based on application requirements.
- **Failure Handling**: Plan for failure scenarios and implement retry and fallback mechanisms.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track transactional states and diagnose issues.

Each pattern and strategy has its strengths and trade-offs, so the choice depends on factors such as transactional complexity, scalability requirements, fault tolerance, and desired consistency guarantees in your distributed system architecture.
